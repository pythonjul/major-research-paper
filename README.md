## Why I made this project? <a name = "why_document"></a>

- It was my Research Paper to validate my master degree.

## Introduction<a name = "how_to_play"></a>
- How do the models used on the Covid-19 epidemic work? We started this work in February 2020. And it was during this same period that Covid-19 was spreading widely in populations around the world. When Professor Jos√© Rolim proposed that we work on this subject after reading the last chapters of the book Networks, Crowds, and Markets, I immediately said yes with enthusiasm, as the subject was so fascinating and topical.

- At the beginning of 2020, we didn't know how our lives would be so impacted afterwards. Scientists all over the world were studying Covid-19 to better understand it. As a result, modelling improved with the knowledge gained about how the virus behaves.

- We will try to understand how an epidemiological model called the SIR model works. This model is regularly used in Covid-19 modelling. 

- How does it behave? What can it achieve? What are its limitations? We will develop each of these questions in the rest of this work.
